# Basic C++ Calculator 🧮

A beginner-friendly **command-line calculator written in C++**.
This project is designed to help beginners practice **basic input/output, functions, and control flow** using a classic `switch-case` statement.

---

## ✨ Features

* User inputs two numbers from the console
* User chooses a calculation method via a menu
* Supported operations:

  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (-)
  * Multiplication (*)
  * Division (/)
* Simple and clear logic suitable for C++ beginners

---

## 🧠 Core Concept: `switch-case`

This project uses the **`switch-case` control structure** in C++ to handle user-selected operations.

### How it works:

* The user enters a number corresponding to an operation
* The program uses `switch-case` to execute the correct calculation
* Each case represents one arithmetic operation

This approach:

* Is easy to read and understand
* Matches classic C/C++ programming style
* Helps beginners learn control flow clearly

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* C++ (ISO standard)
* Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Visual Studio / g++ compatible

---

## ▶️ How to Compile & Run

### Using g++ (recommended)

```bash
g++ basic-cpp-calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```

### Using Visual Studio

* Open the project in Visual Studio
* Build and run the program (`Ctrl + F5`)

---

## 📌 Example Usage

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

Choose operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)

Result: 15
```

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

* Validate user input more strictly
* Handle division by zero
* Allow repeated calculations in a loop
* Refactor code into functions or classes
